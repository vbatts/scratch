Information:
  This is based on the inspiration of the
  lolcat written in ruby (https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat)

  but now with a bit of the speed of C.
  also it has a state file that can keep up with where it
  left off. Neat for sticking something in your $PS1 ;)

Building:
  $> make
  $> make install DESTDIR=`pwd`/tmp

Options:
  To build without the state written to /tmp/lolcat.state,
  just build like:
  $> make no-state
  $> make install DESTDIR=`pwd`/tmp
